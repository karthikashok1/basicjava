variables can change values by assigning itself to another value
Constants never change
In Java programming you need to tell the program what kind of data you need.
Syntax is grammar for programming

 if( anything that evaluates to true/false){

    }else if(anything that evaluates to true/false){

    }else{
        // Anything does not match above.
    }
single = it is called assignment
double == it is called comparison
  
for( initialiation_onetime ; condition_which_should_return_true_or_false ; do_some_increment_which_runs_for_each_loop){
        somestatements_which_will_execute_aslongas_theconditionis_true
    }
